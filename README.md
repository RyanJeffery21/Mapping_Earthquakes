# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map of earthquake data acquired from the web.  Using GeoJSON data we were able to create a multi-layered map that shows recent earthquakes, scales their size and color on the map relative to their magnitude, and has a pop-up that shows location and magnitude.  Fault lines were then added to the map to show their correlation to earthquakes.
